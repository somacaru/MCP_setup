# Autonomous Rule Creation

Create a new rule in .cursor/rules whenever you receive feedback from a user:
- Extract the main point of the feedback
- Create a new rule that captures this as a reusable instruction
- Save the new rule with a short, descriptive name
- Keep rules simple and avoid redundancy

Apply this rule for every edit or create rule.
